<p>Holi is the vibrant Hindu festival celebrating the arrival of spring, the victory of good over evil, and the bonds of love and brotherhood. Celebrated in March, it involves playing with dry colors (gulal) and water, with celebrations including Holika Dahan (a bonfire) the night before. The festival is marked by joyful gatherings, singing, dancing, feasting on traditional sweets like gujiya, and enjoying the refreshing drink thandai.</p>
