Vegetables are the edible parts of a plant—roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, or seeds—consumed as part of a meal, typically savory dishes. Key types include root vegetables like carrots and potatoes, leafy vegetables such as spinach and cabbage, fruit vegetables like tomatoes and cucumbers, and flower vegetables like broccoli.
